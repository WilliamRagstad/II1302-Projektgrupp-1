# HTTP server in Deno using TypeScript
This project contains a HTTP server with a static response of "Hello World" written in TypeScript running on the latest version of Deno.
An important notice is that the standard library used by this server is of the (latest) version *0.91.0*. Some versions of Deno are not compatible with older versions of the standard library.
